hi random people stalking me pls dont hurt me
This account isnt active alot
This account will not have big projects
This account will mainly be forks of projects, If it is just a rebrand it will be noted in the readme and possibly deleted
This account may contribute
this account may eventually make apps that arent poop (may be from a tutorial)
if i need to make a custom theme for my dad's wordpress site it may be here unbranded and with different colors
the code will usually be terrible
 
if you need code that is not a fork relicensed please make a issue request and I will see if it is possible to relicense. the response might be delayed due to inactivity
